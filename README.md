# Variable Assignment

## Objectives

1. Assign a local variable.

## Instructions

You will assign a local variable named `greeting` that is equal to `"Hello World"`.

You should first make sure the test suite is running correctly by running `learn`.

Upon the first run of the test suite you should see:

rspec ./spec/variable_spec.rb:4 # ./variable.rb defined a local variable called greeting and set it equal to 'Hello World'

To solve this test failure, create a local variable `greeting` in the `variable.rb` file. Set `greeting` equal to the string `"Hello World"`. Run `learn` to see if you did this correctly.
